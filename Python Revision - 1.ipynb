We deeply believe that bringing together diversity of thoughts, perspectives and expression is key to building the best product, team and company. We look for many different skills and abilities, as well as how you can enhance Canva and our culture. So, even if you don’t think you quite meet all of the skills listed or tick all the boxes, we’d still love to hear from you!\\n      Our mission at Canva is to empower the world to design and since launching in 2013, we have grown exponentially, amassing over 86 million monthly active users across 190 different countries and a team of over 3,000 people… and the best bit is that we’ve only achieved 1% of what we know we’re capable of.\\n      Join us and design your future. \\n     Here at Canva, we believe that talent goes beyond borders - In order to build a product that's used by millions of people from across the world, we want to foster and develop a workplace that represents this user base.\\n      We’ve relocated Product Designers, Product Managers, Marketers and Engineers from across the world to build the future of Canva together here in Sydney. The team currently represent over 30 different nationalities, speaking more than 50 different languages. \\n     We provide full support with visas and relocation costs for you and your family. All you need to do is apply. \\n     Come join Australia’s #1 best place to work.\\n      About the Product Design team\\n      One of the principles of our design team is to ‘show the future’. As designers we transport the rest of the company into a future we’re yet to build. A big part of the role of a product designer at Canva is to be a visionary—visualising and reinventing the future of design.\\n      Product designers at Canva take the dream and make it something everyone can relate to and rally behind. We start from the very early stages: finding the right problem to tackle, exploring ideas for how to solve it and then refining it into a coherent solution. Our product designers carry out research, brainstorming, sketching, prototyping, and collaboration with our engineers to ship great products.

Our product designers carry out research, brainstorming, sketching, prototyping, and collaboration with our engineers to ship great products. We are empathetic user advocates and respect our users’ opinions through interviews, usability testing, and data analysis, as well as wireframing, flowcharting, and journey mapping to show the different stages that customers go through as they come into contact with Canva.\\n      We have multiple teams hiring product designer, including Education, Video, Payments & Revenue, Onboarding & more...\\n    \\n   \\n   \\n     What we look for \\n    \\n     \\n      \\n       \\n        \\n         \\n          4+ years of experience designing, shipping and iterating on complex digital products\\n         \\n        \\n       \\n      \\n       \\n        \\n         \\n           A portfolio that demonstrates experience in product thinking where you have previously shipped UX/UI design for digital products.\\n         \\n        \\n       \\n      \\n       \\n        \\n         \\n           You are a designer that is constantly inspired—motivating those around you through your passion and drive for what you do.\\n         \\n        \\n       \\n      \\n       \\n        \\n         \\n           You are excited by regularly coming up with new ideas, shipping new products and features that address your users’ real needs.\\n         \\n        \\n       \\n      \\n       \\n        \\n         \\n           You shine through your designs—creating user flows and wireframes that simplify user interactions\\n         \\n        \\n       \\n      \\n       \\n        \\n         \\n           You are eager to visually communicate your ideas through prototypes to test with users.\\n         \\n        \\n       \\n      \\n       \\n        \\n         \\n           You thrive in a collaborative workplace; partnering with other designers, engineers, product developers and other disciplines throughout the company.\\n         \\n        \\n       \\n      \\n       \\n        \\n         \\n           You appreciate big picture thinking.

Fundamental to making design accessible to the world is giving people everywhere a springboard with which to create designs from. Templates are that springboard.\\n      Templates provide inspiration to users, help them visualise what's possible and provide an approachable starting point for our users to get creative. In fact, templates are the way the majority of our users create designs so the templates teams are helping millions of people each week.\\n      Historically, Canva’s templates have been designed by a talented team of internal graphic designers. But last year we launched Canva Creators, a platform that allows anyone to publish their templates and earn money every time they’re used. We believe Canva Creators has the potential to take Canva to the next level of scale, and we want you to be central to that growth.\\n      In this role, you'll collaborate with our founders, Product, Finance, Strategy, Engineering and Researchers to shape the Creators Monetisation strategy.\\n      Initially, this role will be a half of a 1-2 combination we are setting up between the Monetisation Product Manager and this role, the Data and monetisation insights Lead. Together, you will drive the strategy, modelling, shaping, testing and development of Canva Creator’s monetisation approach across templates and elements. This is an amazing opportunity to lead and grow the strategies around monetisation for Creators in an environment that rewards strategic thinking, initiative, creativity, and independence.\\n      This role is about so much more than just “Money, money, money” - our Creators have shared stories about how becoming a Creator enabled them to gain their financial independence and make empowering decisions to put their health and happiness first, buy a new home for their family, leave a job where they were unhappy - see some of the comments below!

You have experience in creating a system for automated performance testing and know how to effectively fit this into a developer’s workflow.\\n      You will be exploring new ways to improve our engineering practices.
